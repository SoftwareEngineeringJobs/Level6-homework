INSERT INTO `paper` VALUES (1, 36, '{\"question\":\"San Francisco Has Become One Huge Metaphor for Economic Inequality in America\\n                A) The fog still chill the morning air and the cable cars till climb halfway to the tars. Yet on the ground, the\\n        Bay area has changed greatly since singer Tony Bennet left his heart here. Silicon Valley and the tech industry\\n        have led the region into a period of unprecedented wealth and innovation. But existing political and land\\n        limits have cau ed an alanning housing crisi and astronomical ri e in ocial and economic difference.\\n                B) While the re ident of mo t citie di play pride and support for their home industrie s, drastic market\\n        distortions in the San Francisco Bay Area ha ve created boiling resen tment in the region towards the tech\\n        indu try. vocal minority is even calling on official to puni h tho e who are benefitting from the economic\\n        and housi ng boom. If this boom and its con equence are not resolved, a drastic increase in social and\\n        economic difference may have a profound impact on the region for generation . A history and analysi of this\\n        transformation may hold invaluable in ight about the opportunitie . Peri l of tech citie are currently being\\n        cultivated acros the US, and indeed around the world.\\n                C) According to a recent tudy, San Franci co rank fir t in alifornia for economic difference. The a erage\\n        income of the top J % of hou ehold in the city averages 3.6 million . Thi i 44 time the average income\\n        of tho e at the bottom, which tand at 81 094. The top l % of the San Franci co penin ula \'s hare of total\\n        income now extends to 30.8% of the region\'s income. This was a dramatic jump from 1989, where it stood at\\n        15.8%.\\n                D) The region\' economy ha been fundamentally transformed by the technology indu try pringing from ilicon\\n        Valley. Policies pushed by Mayor Ed Lee provided tax breaks for tech companies to set up shop along the\\n        city\' long-neglected Mid-Market area. The city i now home to Twitter, Uber, Airbnb, Pintere t, Dropbox\\n        and other . In hort, the Bay Area ha become a global magnet for tho e with pecialized kill , which ha\\n        in turn helped fuel economic enthu iasm, and thi economic growth has reduced unemployment to 3.4%, an\\n        admirable feat.\\n                E) In spite of all that, the strength of the recent job growth, combined with policies that have traditionally limited\\n        hou ing development in the city and throughout the penin ula, did not help ea e the affordability cri i . In\\n        2015 alone, the Bay Area added 64,000 in job . In the ame year, only 5,000 new home were built.\\n                F) With the average house in the city co ting over $ 1.25 million and average flat price over 1.11 million, the\\n        minimum qua lifying income to purchase a hou e ha increased to 254 000. Con idering that the average\\n        household income in the city currently stands at around $80,000, it is not an exaggeration to say that the\\n        dream of home ownership is now beyond the grasp of the vast majority of today\'s people who rent.\\n                G) For generations, the stability and prosperity of the American middle class has been anchored by home ownership. Studies have consistently shown that the value of land has overtaken overall income growth, thus\\n        providing a huge advantage to property owners as a vehicle of wealth building. When home prices soar above\\n        the reach of most households, the gap between the rich and the poor dramatically increases.\\n                H) If contributing factors leading to housing becoming less than affordable are not resolved over multiple\\n        generations, a small elite will control a vast share of the country\'s total wealth. The result? A society where\\n        the threat of class warfare would loom large. A society\'s level of happiness is tied less to measures of\\n        quantitative wealth and more to measures of qualitative wealth. This means that how a person judges their\\n        security in comparison to their neighbors\' has more of an impact on their happiness than their objective\\n        standard of living. At the same time, when a system no longer provides opportunities for the majority to\\n        participate in wealth building, it not only robs those who are excluded from opportunities, but also deprives\\n        them of their dignity.\\n        I) San Francisco and the Bay Area have long been committed to values which embrace inclusion and rejection\\n        of mainstream culture. To see these values coming apart so publicly adds insult to injury for a region\\n        once defined by its progressive social fabric. In the face of resentment, it is human to want revenge. But\\n        deteriorating policies such as heavily taxing technology companies or real estate developers are not likely to\\n        shift the balance.\\n                J) The housing crisis is caused by two primary factors: the growing desirability of the Bay Area as a place\\n        to live due to its excellent economy, and our limited housing stock. Although the city is experiencing an\\n        unprecedented boom in new housing, more units are sorely needed. Protection policies were originally\\n        designed to suppress bad development and boost historic preservation in our urban areas. Now, too many\\n        developers are experiencing excessive delays. Meanwhile, there are the land limitations of the Bay Area to\\n        consider. The region is surrounded by water and mountains. Local governments need to aid development as\\n        well. This means increasing housing density throughout the region and building upwards while streamlining\\n        the approval process.\\n                K) Real estate alone will not solve the problem, of course. Transportation, too, needs to be updated and\\n        infrastructure extended to link distant regions to Silicon Valley and the city. We need to build an effective\\n        high-speed commuting system linking the high-priced and crowded Bay Area with the low-priced and low￾density Central Valley. This would dramatically reduce travel times. And based on the operating speeds of\\n        hovering trains used in countries such as Japan or Spain, high-speed rail could shorten the time to travel\\n        between San Francisco and California\'s capital, Sacramento, or from Stockton to San Jose, to under 30\\n        minutes. This system would bring once distant regions within reasonable commute to heavy job centers.\\n        The city also needs to update existing transportation routes combined with smart home-building policies\\n        that dramatically increase housing density in areas surrounding high-speed rail stations. By doing so, we\\n        will be able to build affordable housing within acceptable commuting distances for a significant bulk of the\\n        workforce.\\n                L) Our threatening housing crisis forces the difficult question of what type of society we would like to be. Will\\n        it be one where the elite command the vast bulk of wealth and regional culture is defined by an aggressive\\n        business world? We were recently treated to a taste of the latter, when local tech employee Justin Keller wrote\\n        an open letter to the city complaining about having to see homeless people on his way to work.\\n\\n                M) It doesn\'t have to be this way. But solutions need to be implemented now, before angry crowds grow from a\\n        nuisance to serious concern. It may take less than you might think. And in fact, the solutions to our housing\\n        crisis are already fairly clear. We need to increase the density of housing units. We need to use existing\\n        technology to shorten travel times and break the land limits. There is a way to solve complex social and\\n        economic problems without abandoning social responsibility. This is the Bay Area\'s opportunity to prove that\\n        it can innovate more than just technology.\\n36.

Now, however, experts are \\nwarning that aiming for a diverse diet may actually lead to just eating more calories, and, thus, to obesity. One \\nissue is that people may not interpret \\\"variety\\\" the way nutritionists intend. This problem is highlighted by new \\nresearch conducted by the American Heart Association. Researchers reviewed all the evidence published related \\nto dietary diversity and saw a correlation between dietary diversity and a greater intake of both healthy and \\nunhealthy foods. This had implications for obesity, as researchers found a greater prevalence of obesity amongst \\npeople with a greater dietary diversity. \\nOne author of the new study explained that their findings contradict standard dietary advice, as most dietary \\nguidelines around the world include a statement of eating a variety of foods. But this advice does not seem to be \\nsupported by science, possibly because there is little agreement about the meaning of \\\"dietary diversity,\\\" whichis not clearly and consistently defined. Some experts measure dietary diversity by counting the number of food \\ngroups eaten, while others look at the distribution of calories across individual foods, and still others measure \\nhow different the foods eaten are from each other. \\nAlthough the findings of this new study contradict standard dietary advice, they do not come as a surprise \\nto all of the researchers involved. Dr. Rao, one of the study authors, noted that, after 20 years of experience in \\nthe field of obesity, he has observed that people who have a regimented lifestyle and diet tend to be thinner and \\nhealthier than people with a wide variety of consumption. This anecdotal evidence matches the conclusions of the \\nstudy, which found no evidence that dietary diversity promotes healthy body weight or optimal eating patterns, \\nand limited evidence shows that eating a variety of foods is actually associated with consuming more calories, \\npoor eating patterns and weight gain. Further, there is some evidence that a greater variety of food options in a \\nsingle meal may delay people\'s feeling offullness and actually increase how much they eat. \\nBased on their findings, the researchers endorse a diet consisting of a limited number of healthy foods such \\nas vegetables, fruits, grains, and poultry. They also recommend that people simultaneously endeavor to restrict \\nconsumption of sweets, sugar and red meat. The researchers stress, however, that their dietary recommendations \\ndo not imply dietary diversity is never positive, and that, in the past, diversity in diets of whole, unprocessed \\nfood may have actually been very beneficial.\\n46.

A new study, however, has shown that what psychologists call same-different discrimination is present in creatures generally seen as unintelligent: newborn ducklings ( ,J, \'Pfii ). \\nThe study, published Thursday in Science, challenges our idea of what it means to have a birdbrain, said \\nEdward Wasserman, an experimental psychologist at the University oflowa who wrote an independent review of \\nthe study. \\n\\\"In fact, birds are extremely intelligent and our problem pretty much lies in figuring out how to get them to \\n\'talk\' to us, or tell us how smart they really are,\\\" he said. \\nAntone Martinho and Alex Kacelnik, co-authors of the new paper, devised a clever experiment to better test \\nbird intelligence. \\nFirst, they took 1-day-old ducklings and exposed them to a pair of moving objects. The two objects were \\neither the same or different in shape or color. Then they exposed each duckling to two entirely new pairs of \\nmoving objects. \\nThe researchers found that about 70% of the ducklings preferred to move toward the pair of objects that \\nhad the same shape or color relationship as the first objects they saw. A duckling that was first shown two green \\nspheres, in other words, was more likely to move toward a pair of blue spheres than a mismatched pair of orange \\nand purple spheres. \\nDucklings go through a rapid learning process called imprinting shortly after birth- it\'s what allows them to \\nidentify and follow their mothers. \\nThese findings suggest that ducklings use abstract relationships between sensory inputs like color, shape, \\nsounds and odor to recognize their mothers, said Dr. Kacelnik. \\nBy studying imprinting, the authors of this study have shown for the first time that an animal can learn \\nrelationships between concepts without training, said Jeffrey Katz, an experimental psychologist at Auburn \\nUniversity who was not involved in the study. \\nPrevious studies have suggested that other animals, including pigeons, dolphins, honeybees and some \\nprimates ( 3( * ~-q; 1h ) , can discern same from different, but only after extensive training. \\nAdding ducklings to the list- particularly untrained newborn ducklings- suggests that the ability to \\ncompare abstract concepts \\\"is far more necessary to a wider variety of animals\' survival than we previously \\nthought,\\\" Dr. Martinho said.

But existing political and land\\n        limits have cau ed an alanning housing crisi and astronomical ri e in ocial and economic difference.\\n                B) While the re ident of mo t citie di play pride and support for their home industrie s, drastic market\\n        distortions in the San Francisco Bay Area ha ve created boiling resen tment in the region towards the tech\\n        indu try. vocal minority is even calling on official to puni h tho e who are benefitting from the economic\\n        and housi ng boom. If this boom and its con equence are not resolved, a drastic increase in social and\\n        economic difference may have a profound impact on the region for generation . A history and analysi of this\\n        transformation may hold invaluable in ight about the opportunitie . Peri l of tech citie are currently being\\n        cultivated acros the US, and indeed around the world.\\n                C) According to a recent tudy, San Franci co rank fir t in alifornia for economic difference. The a erage\\n        income of the top J % of hou ehold in the city averages 3.6 million . Thi i 44 time the average income\\n        of tho e at the bottom, which tand at 81 094. The top l % of the San Franci co penin ula \'s hare of total\\n        income now extends to 30.8% of the region\'s income. This was a dramatic jump from 1989, where it stood at\\n        15.8%.\\n                D) The region\' economy ha been fundamentally transformed by the technology indu try pringing from ilicon\\n        Valley. Policies pushed by Mayor Ed Lee provided tax breaks for tech companies to set up shop along the\\n        city\' long-neglected Mid-Market area. The city i now home to Twitter, Uber, Airbnb, Pintere t, Dropbox\\n        and other . In hort, the Bay Area ha become a global magnet for tho e with pecialized kill , which ha\\n        in turn helped fuel economic enthu iasm, and thi economic growth has reduced unemployment to 3.4%, an\\n        admirable feat.\\n                E) In spite of all that, the strength of the recent job growth, combined with policies that have traditionally limited\\n        hou ing development in the city and throughout the penin ula, did not help ea e the affordability cri i . In\\n        2015 alone, the Bay Area added 64,000 in job . In the ame year, only 5,000 new home were built.\\n                F) With the average house in the city co ting over $ 1.25 million and average flat price over 1.11 million, the\\n        minimum qua lifying income to purchase a hou e ha increased to 254 000. Con idering that the average\\n        household income in the city currently stands at around $80,000, it is not an exaggeration to say that the\\n        dream of home ownership is now beyond the grasp of the vast majority of today\'s people who rent.\\n                G) For generations, the stability and prosperity of the American middle class has been anchored by home ownership. Studies have consistently shown that the value of land has overtaken overall income growth, thus\\n        providing a huge advantage to property owners as a vehicle of wealth building. When home prices soar above\\n        the reach of most households, the gap between the rich and the poor dramatically increases.\\n                H) If contributing factors leading to housing becoming less than affordable are not resolved over multiple\\n        generations, a small elite will control a vast share of the country\'s total wealth. The result? A society where\\n        the threat of class warfare would loom large. A society\'s level of happiness is tied less to measures of\\n        quantitative wealth and more to measures of qualitative wealth. This means that how a person judges their\\n        security in comparison to their neighbors\' has more of an impact on their happiness than their objective\\n        standard of living. At the same time, when a system no longer provides opportunities for the majority to\\n        participate in wealth building, it not only robs those who are excluded from opportunities, but also deprives\\n        them of their dignity.\\n        I) San Francisco and the Bay Area have long been committed to values which embrace inclusion and rejection\\n        of mainstream culture. To see these values coming apart so publicly adds insult to injury for a region\\n        once defined by its progressive social fabric. In the face of resentment, it is human to want revenge. But\\n        deteriorating policies such as heavily taxing technology companies or real estate developers are not likely to\\n        shift the balance.\\n                J) The housing crisis is caused by two primary factors: the growing desirability of the Bay Area as a place\\n        to live due to its excellent economy, and our limited housing stock. Although the city is experiencing an\\n        unprecedented boom in new housing, more units are sorely needed. Protection policies were originally\\n        designed to suppress bad development and boost historic preservation in our urban areas. Now, too many\\n        developers are experiencing excessive delays. Meanwhile, there are the land limitations of the Bay Area to\\n        consider. The region is surrounded by water and mountains. Local governments need to aid development as\\n        well. This means increasing housing density throughout the region and building upwards while streamlining\\n        the approval process.\\n                K) Real estate alone will not solve the problem, of course. Transportation, too, needs to be updated and\\n        infrastructure extended to link distant regions to Silicon Valley and the city. We need to build an effective\\n        high-speed commuting system linking the high-priced and crowded Bay Area with the low-priced and low￾density Central Valley. This would dramatically reduce travel times. And based on the operating speeds of\\n        hovering trains used in countries such as Japan or Spain, high-speed rail could shorten the time to travel\\n        between San Francisco and California\'s capital, Sacramento, or from Stockton to San Jose, to under 30\\n        minutes. This system would bring once distant regions within reasonable commute to heavy job centers.\\n        The city also needs to update existing transportation routes combined with smart home-building policies\\n        that dramatically increase housing density in areas surrounding high-speed rail stations.

Now, however, experts are \\nwarning that aiming for a diverse diet may actually lead to just eating more calories, and, thus, to obesity. One \\nissue is that people may not interpret \\\"variety\\\" the way nutritionists intend. This problem is highlighted by new \\nresearch conducted by the American Heart Association. Researchers reviewed all the evidence published related \\nto dietary diversity and saw a correlation between dietary diversity and a greater intake of both healthy and \\nunhealthy foods. This had implications for obesity, as researchers found a greater prevalence of obesity amongst \\npeople with a greater dietary diversity. \\nOne author of the new study explained that their findings contradict standard dietary advice, as most dietary \\nguidelines around the world include a statement of eating a variety of foods. But this advice does not seem to be \\nsupported by science, possibly because there is little agreement about the meaning of \\\"dietary diversity,\\\" whichis not clearly and consistently defined. Some experts measure dietary diversity by counting the number of food \\ngroups eaten, while others look at the distribution of calories across individual foods, and still others measure \\nhow different the foods eaten are from each other. \\nAlthough the findings of this new study contradict standard dietary advice, they do not come as a surprise \\nto all of the researchers involved. Dr. Rao, one of the study authors, noted that, after 20 years of experience in \\nthe field of obesity, he has observed that people who have a regimented lifestyle and diet tend to be thinner and \\nhealthier than people with a wide variety of consumption. This anecdotal evidence matches the conclusions of the \\nstudy, which found no evidence that dietary diversity promotes healthy body weight or optimal eating patterns, \\nand limited evidence shows that eating a variety of foods is actually associated with consuming more calories, \\npoor eating patterns and weight gain. Further, there is some evidence that a greater variety of food options in a \\nsingle meal may delay people\'s feeling offullness and actually increase how much they eat. \\nBased on their findings, the researchers endorse a diet consisting of a limited number of healthy foods such \\nas vegetables, fruits, grains, and poultry. They also recommend that people simultaneously endeavor to restrict \\nconsumption of sweets, sugar and red meat. The researchers stress, however, that their dietary recommendations \\ndo not imply dietary diversity is never positive, and that, in the past, diversity in diets of whole, unprocessed \\nfood may have actually been very beneficial.\\n46.

A new study, however, has shown that what psychologists call same-different discrimination is present in creatures generally seen as unintelligent: newborn ducklings ( ,J, \'Pfii ). \\nThe study, published Thursday in Science, challenges our idea of what it means to have a birdbrain, said \\nEdward Wasserman, an experimental psychologist at the University oflowa who wrote an independent review of \\nthe study. \\n\\\"In fact, birds are extremely intelligent and our problem pretty much lies in figuring out how to get them to \\n\'talk\' to us, or tell us how smart they really are,\\\" he said. \\nAntone Martinho and Alex Kacelnik, co-authors of the new paper, devised a clever experiment to better test \\nbird intelligence. \\nFirst, they took 1-day-old ducklings and exposed them to a pair of moving objects. The two objects were \\neither the same or different in shape or color. Then they exposed each duckling to two entirely new pairs of \\nmoving objects. \\nThe researchers found that about 70% of the ducklings preferred to move toward the pair of objects that \\nhad the same shape or color relationship as the first objects they saw. A duckling that was first shown two green \\nspheres, in other words, was more likely to move toward a pair of blue spheres than a mismatched pair of orange \\nand purple spheres. \\nDucklings go through a rapid learning process called imprinting shortly after birth- it\'s what allows them to \\nidentify and follow their mothers. \\nThese findings suggest that ducklings use abstract relationships between sensory inputs like color, shape, \\nsounds and odor to recognize their mothers, said Dr. Kacelnik. \\nBy studying imprinting, the authors of this study have shown for the first time that an animal can learn \\nrelationships between concepts without training, said Jeffrey Katz, an experimental psychologist at Auburn \\nUniversity who was not involved in the study. \\nPrevious studies have suggested that other animals, including pigeons, dolphins, honeybees and some \\nprimates ( 3( * ~-q; 1h ) , can discern same from different, but only after extensive training. \\nAdding ducklings to the list- particularly untrained newborn ducklings- suggests that the ability to \\ncompare abstract concepts \\\"is far more necessary to a wider variety of animals\' survival than we previously \\nthought,\\\" Dr. Martinho said. He believes the ability is so crucial because it helps animals consider context when \\nidentifying objects in their environment. \\nIt\'s clear from this study and others like it that \\\"animals process and appreciate far more of the intricacies in \\ntheir world than we\'ve ever understood,\\\" Dr. Wasserman said. \\\"We are in a revolutionary phase in terms of our \\nability to understand the minds of other animals.\\\"\\n51 .

Con idering that the average\\n        household income in the city currently stands at around $80,000, it is not an exaggeration to say that the\\n        dream of home ownership is now beyond the grasp of the vast majority of today\'s people who rent.\\n                G) For generations, the stability and prosperity of the American middle class has been anchored by home ownership. Studies have consistently shown that the value of land has overtaken overall income growth, thus\\n        providing a huge advantage to property owners as a vehicle of wealth building. When home prices soar above\\n        the reach of most households, the gap between the rich and the poor dramatically increases.\\n                H) If contributing factors leading to housing becoming less than affordable are not resolved over multiple\\n        generations, a small elite will control a vast share of the country\'s total wealth. The result? A society where\\n        the threat of class warfare would loom large. A society\'s level of happiness is tied less to measures of\\n        quantitative wealth and more to measures of qualitative wealth. This means that how a person judges their\\n        security in comparison to their neighbors\' has more of an impact on their happiness than their objective\\n        standard of living. At the same time, when a system no longer provides opportunities for the majority to\\n        participate in wealth building, it not only robs those who are excluded from opportunities, but also deprives\\n        them of their dignity.\\n        I) San Francisco and the Bay Area have long been committed to values which embrace inclusion and rejection\\n        of mainstream culture. To see these values coming apart so publicly adds insult to injury for a region\\n        once defined by its progressive social fabric. In the face of resentment, it is human to want revenge. But\\n        deteriorating policies such as heavily taxing technology companies or real estate developers are not likely to\\n        shift the balance.\\n                J) The housing crisis is caused by two primary factors: the growing desirability of the Bay Area as a place\\n        to live due to its excellent economy, and our limited housing stock. Although the city is experiencing an\\n        unprecedented boom in new housing, more units are sorely needed. Protection policies were originally\\n        designed to suppress bad development and boost historic preservation in our urban areas. Now, too many\\n        developers are experiencing excessive delays. Meanwhile, there are the land limitations of the Bay Area to\\n        consider. The region is surrounded by water and mountains. Local governments need to aid development as\\n        well. This means increasing housing density throughout the region and building upwards while streamlining\\n        the approval process.\\n                K) Real estate alone will not solve the problem, of course. Transportation, too, needs to be updated and\\n        infrastructure extended to link distant regions to Silicon Valley and the city. We need to build an effective\\n        high-speed commuting system linking the high-priced and crowded Bay Area with the low-priced and low￾density Central Valley. This would dramatically reduce travel times. And based on the operating speeds of\\n        hovering trains used in countries such as Japan or Spain, high-speed rail could shorten the time to travel\\n        between San Francisco and California\'s capital, Sacramento, or from Stockton to San Jose, to under 30\\n        minutes. This system would bring once distant regions within reasonable commute to heavy job centers.\\n        The city also needs to update existing transportation routes combined with smart home-building policies\\n        that dramatically increase housing density in areas surrounding high-speed rail stations. By doing so, we\\n        will be able to build affordable housing within acceptable commuting distances for a significant bulk of the\\n        workforce.\\n                L) Our threatening housing crisis forces the difficult question of what type of society we would like to be. Will\\n        it be one where the elite command the vast bulk of wealth and regional culture is defined by an aggressive\\n        business world? We were recently treated to a taste of the latter, when local tech employee Justin Keller wrote\\n        an open letter to the city complaining about having to see homeless people on his way to work.\\n\\n                M) It doesn\'t have to be this way. But solutions need to be implemented now, before angry crowds grow from a\\n        nuisance to serious concern. It may take less than you might think. And in fact, the solutions to our housing\\n        crisis are already fairly clear. We need to increase the density of housing units. We need to use existing\\n        technology to shorten travel times and break the land limits. There is a way to solve complex social and\\n        economic problems without abandoning social responsibility. This is the Bay Area\'s opportunity to prove that\\n        it can innovate more than just technology.\\n36.

Now, however, experts are \\nwarning that aiming for a diverse diet may actually lead to just eating more calories, and, thus, to obesity. One \\nissue is that people may not interpret \\\"variety\\\" the way nutritionists intend. This problem is highlighted by new \\nresearch conducted by the American Heart Association. Researchers reviewed all the evidence published related \\nto dietary diversity and saw a correlation between dietary diversity and a greater intake of both healthy and \\nunhealthy foods. This had implications for obesity, as researchers found a greater prevalence of obesity amongst \\npeople with a greater dietary diversity. \\nOne author of the new study explained that their findings contradict standard dietary advice, as most dietary \\nguidelines around the world include a statement of eating a variety of foods. But this advice does not seem to be \\nsupported by science, possibly because there is little agreement about the meaning of \\\"dietary diversity,\\\" whichis not clearly and consistently defined. Some experts measure dietary diversity by counting the number of food \\ngroups eaten, while others look at the distribution of calories across individual foods, and still others measure \\nhow different the foods eaten are from each other. \\nAlthough the findings of this new study contradict standard dietary advice, they do not come as a surprise \\nto all of the researchers involved. Dr. Rao, one of the study authors, noted that, after 20 years of experience in \\nthe field of obesity, he has observed that people who have a regimented lifestyle and diet tend to be thinner and \\nhealthier than people with a wide variety of consumption. This anecdotal evidence matches the conclusions of the \\nstudy, which found no evidence that dietary diversity promotes healthy body weight or optimal eating patterns, \\nand limited evidence shows that eating a variety of foods is actually associated with consuming more calories, \\npoor eating patterns and weight gain. Further, there is some evidence that a greater variety of food options in a \\nsingle meal may delay people\'s feeling offullness and actually increase how much they eat. \\nBased on their findings, the researchers endorse a diet consisting of a limited number of healthy foods such \\nas vegetables, fruits, grains, and poultry. They also recommend that people simultaneously endeavor to restrict \\nconsumption of sweets, sugar and red meat. The researchers stress, however, that their dietary recommendations \\ndo not imply dietary diversity is never positive, and that, in the past, diversity in diets of whole, unprocessed \\nfood may have actually been very beneficial.\\n46.

The two objects were \\neither the same or different in shape or color. Then they exposed each duckling to two entirely new pairs of \\nmoving objects. \\nThe researchers found that about 70% of the ducklings preferred to move toward the pair of objects that \\nhad the same shape or color relationship as the first objects they saw. A duckling that was first shown two green \\nspheres, in other words, was more likely to move toward a pair of blue spheres than a mismatched pair of orange \\nand purple spheres. \\nDucklings go through a rapid learning process called imprinting shortly after birth- it\'s what allows them to \\nidentify and follow their mothers. \\nThese findings suggest that ducklings use abstract relationships between sensory inputs like color, shape, \\nsounds and odor to recognize their mothers, said Dr. Kacelnik. \\nBy studying imprinting, the authors of this study have shown for the first time that an animal can learn \\nrelationships between concepts without training, said Jeffrey Katz, an experimental psychologist at Auburn \\nUniversity who was not involved in the study. \\nPrevious studies have suggested that other animals, including pigeons, dolphins, honeybees and some \\nprimates ( 3( * ~-q; 1h ) , can discern same from different, but only after extensive training. \\nAdding ducklings to the list- particularly untrained newborn ducklings- suggests that the ability to \\ncompare abstract concepts \\\"is far more necessary to a wider variety of animals\' survival than we previously \\nthought,\\\" Dr. Martinho said.
